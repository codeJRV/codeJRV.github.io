<div style="text-align: justify">

Over the span of more than 10 years in the industry, I have gained expertise in various facets of **applied Artificial Intelligence**, especially around Security and Scalablity of AI in Cloud Computing, Generative AI and Unmanned Systems.
I have been fortunate to work on some of the most cutting-edge technology in engineering, an overview of which can be found below.

<div style="text-align: justify">

Building state-of-the-art **Generative AI** products under [NVIDIA Picasso Edify](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/picasso/).
Responsible for **AI Safety and Security** of the products, and a founding member of the [Red Team](https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-red-teaming-gen-AI) :triangular_flag_on_post: efforts to ensure safe, unbiased and **trustworthy AI**.

Deployed text-to-image, image-to-image, text-to-3d, image-to-3d AI models in partnership with [Getty Images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDle-HsJgwE) and
 led research-to-production pipeline bring-up to enable **continuous deployment** of the latest AI models and checkpoints, with a turnaround time of less than 3 hours.

I also mentor junior engineers and conduct technical interviews for new hires.

Conducted research with [Prof. Srikant Saripalli](https://unmanned.tamu.edu/team/) to analyse classifier performance for Traffic Sign Detection. Performed PCA and t-SNE analysis to study in-class variation of traffic signs installed across the state of Texas.
Developed an [ultra-high-speed sign detection & classification framework](https://github.com/codeJRV/HighSpeedTracking) for traffic signs inspired by research on kernelized correlation filters from Visual Geometry Group, University of Oxford. Current results : **350 fps**

Part of team of 12 at the [world's largest 3 wheeler automaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bajaj_Auto#cite_note-4), handling the **entire end-to-end automation** effort within Bajaj Auto's manufacturing sector. Introduced Sync-Slide robot, a collaborative robotic bolt tightening system with image processing, force feedback and
selective compliance.

Working with Prof. [Debashish Ghose](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=BUfKuTYAAAAJ&hl=en) I developed algorithms for Path Planning for Quadcopters to Survey Damaged Building Area. The relevance of this project has had a deeper impact on me, following the 2013 Kedarnath floods.
These algorithms enable disaster response teams to rapidly deploy a team of various autonomous quadcopters over the disaster scenario to identify and locate survivors within the first few hours of the disaster, so that rescue teams could directly 'approach' the location of the trapped survivors, without having to spend valuable time and effort searching for them.
[My work](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/unmanned-aerial-systems/9780128202777/?_gl=1*pakr31*_ga*MTEyNDE3NDcxNS4xNzI0NTYzOTE2*_ga_092EL089CH*MTcyNDU2MzkxNi4xLjAuMTcyNDU2MzkxOS41Ny4wLjA.) lays down the foundation strategies and mathematical algorithms to achieve this end.
