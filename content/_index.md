I specialize in Artificial Intelligence at Nvidia, focusing on Generative AI, AI security, the scalability of AI in cloud computing, and applications in autonomous systems.

I currently lead the deployment and security of Gen-AI models for visual applications at Nvidia's Edify line of products, which includes state-of-the-art models such as text-to-image, image-to-3D, and fine-tuning. I also play a key role in building and maintaining SDKs, libraries, and APIs to support internal teams with cloud infrastructure. 

Previously, I worked with the Autonomous Vehicles business unit at Nvidia, focusing on hyper-scale simulation, replay, and validation of self-driving vehicles in the cloud. I was instrumental in optimizing performance for DRIVE simulation and augmented re-simulators, significantly enhancing data-center utilization and workflow efficiency. My work has enabled autonomous vehicles to become safer, by training them to drive billions of miles in photorealistic virtual worlds by performing hardware-in-the-loop simulation. My earlier roles involved leading impactful projects in robot simulation and industrial automation for the software simulation leader (Dassault Systèmes SE) and the world's largest 3-wheeler automaker (Bajaj Auto) respectively.

I hold a Master’s in Computer Science from Texas A&M University and a Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering from National Institute of Technology Calicut. I have also developed multiple patented technologies in robotics and authored a seminal work on disaster management using autonomous quadcopter swarms, published in a book chapter by Elsevier. 

As a domain expert in AI and unmanned systems, I’ve contributed to various articles and conferences including showcasing the world's first map of music at ACM Multimedia. Outside of work, I currently review for NeurIPS on the AI Ethics panel and judge various industry competitions. Previously, I’ve shared my expertise as an instructor at robotics workshops, such as RobArch at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.
