I currently lead the deployment and security of **Generative-AI models for visual applications** at Nvidia's [Picasso Edify](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/picasso/) line of products, which includes state-of-the-art models such as text-to-image, image-to-3D, and fine-tuning. I am responsible for **AI Safety and Security** of the products, and a founding member of the [Red Team](https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-red-teaming-gen-AI) :triangular_flag_on_post: efforts to ensure safe, unbiased and **trustworthy AI**.

Previously, I worked with the [Autonomous Vehicles business unit at Nvidia](https://developer.nvidia.com/drive), focusing on hyper-scale simulation, replay, and validation of self-driving vehicles in the cloud. I was instrumental in optimizing performance for [DRIVE simulation](https://developer.nvidia.com/drive/simulation) and [augmented re-simulator](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/researching-and-developing-an-autonomous-vehicle-lane-following-system/#testing_the_network_augmented_resimulator), significantly enhancing data-center utilization and workflow efficiency. My work has enabled autonomous vehicles to become safer, by training them to drive billions of miles in photorealistic virtual worlds by performing hardware-in-the-loop simulation. My earlier roles involved leading [impactful projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8Wjh7Zmf0U) in robot simulation and industrial automation for the software simulation leader (Dassault Systèmes SE) and the world's largest 3-wheeler automaker (Bajaj Auto) respectively.

I hold a Master’s in Computer Science from Texas A&M University and a Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering from National Institute of Technology Calicut. I have also developed multiple patented technologies in robotics and authored a seminal work on disaster management using autonomous quadcopter swarms,[ published in a book chapter](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128202760000133) by Elsevier.

As a domain expert in AI and unmanned systems, I’ve contributed to various articles and conferences including showcasing the [world's first map of music](https://1millionsmiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/music-mapper-ml-project-presentation.pdf) at ACM Multimedia. Outside of work, I currently review for NeurIPS on the AI Ethics panel and judge various industry competitions. Previously, I’ve shared my expertise as an instructor at robotics workshops, such as [RobArch](https://www.robarch2018.org/clay-3d-printing-arbitrary-surfaces/) at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.
